CerebroVoice: Bilingual sEEG Speech Dataset
=============================================

Overview
--------
Intracranial EEG (sEEG) recordings from 2 epilepsy patients during bilingual
speech tasks (Mandarin Chinese, English, and digit reading). Recorded at
1000 Hz with Nihon Kohden EEG-1200, depth electrodes (platinum-iridium).

Data distributed as preprocessed NPY derivatives:
- LFS: Low-frequency signal
- HGA: High-gamma activity
- BBS: HGA and LFS channels stacked (first half = HGA, second half = LFS, sample-identical), not a separate broadband signal

All features are z-scored per 1.5 s trial (each channel has mean 0 and SD 1 within every trial), so they are unitless;
runs are trials concatenated back to back.

Tasks: Chinese reading, English reading, digit reading
Subjects: SUB1 (114 channels post-filtering), SUB2 (158 channels)
Duration: ~73 min (SUB1), ~76 min (SUB2)
